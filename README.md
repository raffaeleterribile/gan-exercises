# Exercises on GAN

These notebook are based on this article: [Generative Adversarial Networks: Build Your FIrst Models - Real Python](https://realpython.com/generative-adversarial-networks/#the-architecture-of-generative-adversarial-networks).

In the article was suggested to use Pytorch 1.4.0, but I want to try with latest version of Pytorch (Pytorch 1.12.0) and latest CUDA drivers (CUDA 11.6).
